This is a report documenting the work done during the helicopter lab in TTK4135, Optimisation and Control. The goal of the lab was to apply optimisation and control theory in practice on a "duocopter" with three degrees of freedom, hence referred to as the helicopter. We have derived a model of the helicopter, calculated an optimal trajectory based on the model and applied it to the helicopter in open loop as well as in closed loop. This is done two times, first while only considering the pitch and travel, keeping the elevation fixed. Then including the elevation in the optimisation problem, by simulating a mountain the helicopter had to avoid.
