\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The field of mathematical optimization is very applicable to automatic control for a wide range of systems. In this document, we describe ways to compute an optimal trajectory for a helicopter that is supposed to (a) lift off the ground at start-up, (b) travel $180^\circ$ around (change yaw angle), and (c) stop when this move has been executed.\\
\\
We first do this in an open loop situation (\cref{sec:open_loop_optimal}), before introducing feedback based on a linear quadratic regulator (\cref{sec:linear_quadratic}). We finally introduce a "mountain constraint" - that is, a small top the elevation of the helicopter must fly over as it makes its yaw sweep. This is done in \cref{sec:two_dimensions} and \cref{sec:optional_constraints}.\\

All necessary optimization computations are performed in the software MATLAB. Relevant code parts are included throughout this document, and the entire scripts are listed in \cref{sec:matlab}.
