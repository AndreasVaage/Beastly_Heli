Before we start on more advanced control theory we tested the helicopter and the given PD- and PID- controller for pitch and elevation respectively.

        \caption{First flight testing the pitch PD-controller and the elevation PID-controller, the elevation reference is zero degrees.} 
\label{fig:repetition} 
\end{figure}

As we can see in \cref{fig:repetition} the elevation reaches zero degrees as it should, but the pitch, which is controlled by a PD-controller has a few degrees standard deviation. This is intended to prevent drift in the travel caused by the fact that both rotors rotate in the same direction, thus creating a torque causing the helicopter to travel. Thus the standard pitch deviation is in fact a feed foreword to eliminate standard deviation in travel speed.\\

Both controllers gave satisfactory performance, and provided a good base for more advanced control engineering.
